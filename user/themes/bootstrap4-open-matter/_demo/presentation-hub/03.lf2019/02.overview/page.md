#### Keywords

#### Session Description
Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptop to this session
Tech-savvy educators and authors - want to support more open and collaborative materials, inside or outside of other platforms? Are you looking for a more flexible workflow and environment than what traditional CMSs like WordPress provides? Faced with these challenges, Paul Hibbitts developed a set of open source components for the file-based [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org) to work with his [CMPT-363 Canvas course](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/47119).

The modern CMS Grav uses the platform-independent Markdown format and enables version-controlled editing with Git services such as GitHub and GitLab. These also naturally support the 5 Rs (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix and Redistribute) of Open Educational Resources. Integrating Grav pages within other systems (e.g. LMSs) is seamless too - without any content restrictions. In this session, participants will get to explore Markdown and the latest release of Grav with various open education-related projects (such as the Open Course/MultiCourse Hub and Open Publishing Space). You can also learn more about these Grav projects, and others, at [hibbittsdesign.org](https://hibbittsdesign.org).
