⚡️**Tip** A Grav page containing one or more Presentations can be displayed 'chromelessly' (without site navigation bar, sidebar and footer ) within another system, such as an LMS. This technique will also automatically provide a link to view each Presentation fullscreen and, if configured, a Git Sync Link (i.e. GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.).  

For example, add `/chromeless:true` to the URL of this page to view the 'chromeless' version!
