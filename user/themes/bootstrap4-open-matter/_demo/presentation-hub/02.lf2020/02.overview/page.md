### üë©‚ÄçüíªUsing Grav as an Open Personal Publishing Platform

#### Session Objectives
* Identify Markdown, Git, and a Git Workflow
* List advantages of a Markdown Git Workflow with Grav
* Experience of several examples of open education packages for Grav

#### Session Description
Tech-savvy educators and authors - want to support more open and collaborative materials, inside or outside of other systems? Are you looking for a more flexible workflow and environment than what traditional CMSs like WordPress provides? Faced with these challenges, Paul Hibbitts developed a set of open source components for the file-based [Grav CMS](https:getgrav.org) to work with his [CMPT-363 Canvas course](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/47119).

The modern CMS Grav uses the platform-independent Markdown format and enables collaborative editing with Git-based services such as GitHub and GitLab. These also naturally support the 5 Rs (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix and Redistribute) of Open Educational Resources. Integrating Grav pages within other systems (e.g. LMSs) is seamless too - without any content restrictions. In this session, Paul will highlight various open education-related projects (including the Open Course Hub, Open Publishing Space, the Hypothes.is Plugin and more!) and invite attendees to share their own experiences and needs.
